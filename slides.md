* "With the support of Robotium, test case developers can write function, system and acceptance test scenarios, spanning multiple Android activities."
* Open source and lots of community support
* Extends JUnit style and conventions so there is almost no learning curve.

#What else can we do?
* maven plugins for testing after compiling
* maven plugin + jenkins for CI builds
